# ðŸ§¬ Dynamic Structural Insights into RORÎ³t Binding with Agonist and Antagonist  
_Dissertation Project â€“ Shantanu Kumar_

</div>

---

In this project, we study how small molecule agonists and antagonists interact with the RORÎ³t nuclear receptor using molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The goal is to elucidate structural determinants and conformational changes that differentiate agonist vs antagonist behavior, which is crucial for drug discovery targeting autoimmune diseases and cancer.
